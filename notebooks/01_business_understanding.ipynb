        "# Business Understanding: Customer Churn Prediction\n",
        "# Project Overview\n",
        "The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn in a telecommunications setting. Accurately identifying customers at risk of leaving allows businesses to proactively retain valuable clients, optimize marketing efforts and enhance overall customer satisfaction. This initial setup involves understanding the business context, exploring the dataset and clarifying how model outcomes will influence strategic decisions.\n",
        "# Business Context and Importance\n",
        "The departure of subscribers, or customer churn, is a critical issue for telecom providers because it negatively affects their revenue and overall business growth. Even a small reduction in churn rate can result in millions of dollars in saved costs and increased profits. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, the company can target those individuals with retention offers or customer service interventions ultimately improving loyalty and lifetime value.\n",
        "# Key Questions and Insights\n",
        "**1. Which features are most predictive of churn?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on preliminary observations, customers with high voicemail usage, frequent daytime calls, and lower nighttime charges tend to churn more often. These behaviors may indicate dissatisfaction or attempt to resolve issues. Formal analysis suggests that features like voicemail count, total day minutes and customer service calls are likely strong indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Why is the dataset imbalanced and how does this impact model building?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains approximately 14% churners and 86% non-churners, creating an imbalance that can bias the model toward predicting non-churn. This skews accuracy metrics but masks the model's ability to identify at-risk customers. To counter this, we will use stratified splits class weighting and resampling techniques like SMOTE to ensure the model learns patterns relevant to churn behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What actions can the business take based on model outputs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Flagging high-risk customers can enables targeted retention strategies such as personalized offers, follow-up calls, or service improvements. Insight into usage patterns allows product teams to enhance features like voicemail or address common pain points. Efficiently allocating marketing resources toward at-risk segments reduces customer attrition costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. How will we measure success from a business perspective?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond technical accuracy, success involves tangible business metrics: Reduction in churn rate (e.g. from 14% to 10%) post-intervention, Increased customer lifetime value through retention strategies, Return on Investment (ROI) of targeted retention campaigns, and Balancing high recall for churners with acceptable precision to minimize wasted incentives.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Final Thoughts\n",
        "This project combines data-driven insights with practical business strategies. By understanding the drivers of customer churn and developing an accurate predictive model, the organization can foster a more loyal customer base, optimize operational costs, and enhance overall profitability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns to prepare the dataset for modeling."
